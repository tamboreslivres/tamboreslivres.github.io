                In Brazil, and all around the world, popular culture itself has often been an act of resistance, a forum where traditions are kept alive, where communities stick together and express their art and culture, overcoming many obstacles and difficulties. Together we have the power to stand up to injustice, and protect our planet. Through resistance and education we can initiate change and make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have lots more planned, from fundraising events to education workshops. Please check back soon to find out more.

            <h4>Notting Hill Carnival 2019</h4>
            <p>
                In a Carnival first, our 7 groups from the UK and Brazil performed as one, to celebrate unity and raise awareness for human and environmental rights, justice and equality in Brazil.  We paraded in the knowledge that resistance shapes culture and saves communities. Everyone was welcome – We were joined by participants from far wide to wave banners, raise placards, and make some noise. Photos coming soon!
            </p>
            <h4>Our theme: Heroes and Heroines of Brazilian resistance</h4>
            <p>
                Tambores Livres celebrates the lives and struggles of 3 Heroes of Brazilian resistance – Mestre Môa de Katendê, Marielle Franco and Caboclo 2 de Julho. The project has the approval of the families and loved ones of Mestre Moa and Marielle Franco and is in solidarity with indigenous activists across Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tambores Livres honours their drive, commitment and passion for unity and justice.
