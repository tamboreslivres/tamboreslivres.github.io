                <strong><a href="/join"></a>Join us</strong> at
                <strong>Notting Hill Carnival</strong> in a
                vibrant Brazilian style parade for democracy and human rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Across London a movement is taking shape.
                A movement of socially concerned Brazilians and people of
                all corners of the world who are determined to shine a light on
                those that have resisted and continue to fight for rights and
                democracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>TAMBORES LIVRES</strong> is an unprecedented
                <a href="/collaborators">collaboration</a> between different
                Brazilian musical, cultural groups, which are coming together
                to celebrate Brazilian heroes and heroines at Notting Hill
                Carnival. Tambores livres is a loud response to the rise of the
                far right in Brazil, where anti-democratic attitudes are
                growing; activists, politicians, community and cultural leaders
                are being assassinated; political figures are being falsely
                imprisoned; and the deforestation of the Amazonian rain forest
                is accelerating on an unforeseen scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tambores Livres will be celebrating the lives and struggles of
                three Brazilian heroes/heroines,
                <strong>MARIELLE FRANCO</strong>, <strong>MESTRE MOA</strong>
                and <strong>CABOCLO  2 de JULHO</strong> to the sound of a
                Berimbau Orchestra, four maracatu and samba reggae bands,
                dancers, placards/banners and very special guests.
