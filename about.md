        NEW CARNIVAL BAND — TAMBORES LIVRES —
        LAUNCH THEIR THEME FOR THIS YEARS
        <br/> NOTTING HILL CARNIVAL PARADE
    </h4>
</div>

Right now, as you are reading this, across London, the UK and in Brazil, a
movement is taking shape. A movement of socially concerned Brazilians and friends
who are determined to shine a light on those that have resisted and continue to
resist.

In Brazil, popular culture itself has often been an act of resistance, a forum
where traditions are kept alive, where afro-Brazilian communities stick together
and express their art and culture, overcoming many obstacles and difficulties.

Resistance shapes culture and saves communities.

So, at the end of last year, several groups, from different Brazilian musical and
cultural traditions, realised that after meeting at socially conscious Brazilian
events and protests at the end of last year, that they needed to express a
heartfelt, explosive, cohesive and artistic message through music, dance and
chants, costumes and banners, placards and movement, and lots of drums, together
at Notting Hill Carnival in 2019.

And to celebrate this, these groups created a brand-new carnival band,
**_Tambores Livres_** (Free Drums), for the 2019 Notting Hill Carnival.  

And they decided to make their theme (enredo): **HEROES AND HEROINES OF BRAZILIAN
RESISTANCE**.

Each section within this larger carnival band chose their own hero or heroine, so
Tambores Livres will be celebrating the lives and struggles of **Mestre Moa de
Katende**, **Marielle Franco** and **Caboclo 2 de Julho**.

The project has the approval of the families and loved ones of Mestre Moa and
Marielle Franco and is in solidarity with indigenous activists across Brazil.

In preparation for the work needed to put this on, *Baque de Axé* coordinated a
funding proposal, on behalf of all the groups, and the project has been awarded
an Arts Council National Lottery Award Project Grant (ACNLPG) to develop this as
a Carnival project.

The project brings together different musical traditions to perform together and
separately, provides resources for the band leaders to work together, for the
different bands to meet and play, and provides resources and finance for a series
of music and cultural education workshops for children in schools and community
groups, based on the newly composed music of Tambores Livres and the Afro-
Brazilian cultural traditions from which it derives.

The musical/performance groups working together on this project are *Capoeira
MarAzul*, *Baque Luar*, *Baque de Axé*, *Baque de Ogum Tribo*, and they are
being supported in carnival development by Carnival Arts collective *Selva*.

Also collaborating is the Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico carnival and cultural
group from Recife, Brazil, whose leader Mestre Chacon is visiting London in the
run up carnival. Two of the Nação’s percussionists and teachers will be also
parading and performing, representing the group on the day of carnival.


### THE CARNIVAL SONG (ENREDO)

During his visit to London, Mestre Chacon will be working with the band leaders on the new song. The song will involve a wide range of Brazilian percussion instruments including berimbaus, the drums of the maracatu and samba reggae traditions and will be sung by every Tambores Livres participant at carnival.

To make this happen, the groups will perform separately in their own sections and also come together to perform this special piece.


### THE HEROES AND HEROINE, THE BANDS, THE PROCESSION – CARNIVAL!

On the day of the procession, different musical groups with dancers and costume
wearers will represent the different heroes.

We are inviting members of the public to get involved… there are workshops in
music making, carnival decoration, dance and more.

We are particularly looking for those who want to come out with us in our
specially designed t-shirt, to sing and shout, and let it all out in support of
conscious and progressive art, culture and life in Brazil, in celebration of
resistance, unity and positivity.

Get involved, you might end up waering a costume, holding a rope, handing out
water, holding a placard.

#### MESTRE MOA

At the front of the parade **Capoeira MarAzul** will lead a berimbau Orchestra to celebrate the life of the great **Mestre Moa do Katende**, who was stabbed and killed in the run up to last’s year’s General Election in Brazil, when he expressed his support for a socially progressive candidate.

Since its foundation in São Paulo in 1983, *Capoeira MarAzul* has implemented social, educational and cultural programmes using Capoeira and can be found in London and Southampton in the UK, Lisbon, Portugal and Maputo, Mozambique.

The group is led by *Mestre Joãozinho da Figueira*, who is the perfect person to bring together the great capoeristas of London for this emotive creation of the Berimbau Orchestra in honour of Mestre Moa, and is being supported in this project by *Mestre Nelio* of *Grove Capoeira*.

#### MARIELLE FRANCO

The second section of the carnival procession will celebrate the
politician and activist **Marielle Franco**, who was assassinated in 2018 because of her work standing up for the rights of favela dwellers and the poor in Rio de Janeiro.

For this section of the carnival presentation, three maracatu bands are getting together to perform as one group. *Baque Luar*, *Baque de Axé* and Baque de Ogum to make a ‘Baque for Marielle’.

At the front of the Baque – the maracatu drum ensemble, leading the song and celebration will be **Baque Luar**, which has emerged as a small women’s-only maracatu band specialising in professional stage performances focused on their own compositions, and excellent individual musical, dancing and singing skills. The group is led by Lizzie Ogle, who has spent a great deal of time in Brazil, performing, recording, researching, composing and supporting traditional music and the work of traditional musicians, in particular Mestre Afonso and Maracatu Nação Leão Coroado.
In the run up to carnival and on the day of the carnival parade, Baque Luar will be working Thalita Domingues , from *Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico* and who also leads *Maracatu Asé d’Ori*, in Aracaju, Brazil, with *Bigato Pereira*.

**Baque de Axé** is a London based maracatu band affiliated to *Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico* and won third prize in the Brazilian Band category in the 2018 Notting Hill Carnival. Founder and Band leader *Sam Alexander* is the Carnival Director of the Tambores Livres project, and has led *Baque de Axé* (and other Brazilian percussion groups) many times at Notting Hill Carnival over the last three decades.

**Baque de Ogum** was founded in 2017 and is based in County Durham. The band is affiliated to Nação Do Maracatu Porto Rico, with whom they have developed a successful ongoing partnership of cultural exchange between Brazil and the UK. The percussion ensemble is directed by the phenomenal teenage talent of *Sam Ward-Hardy*, who has studied and performed in Brazil with *Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico* and others.

*Sam Ward-Hardy* will be directing this joint maracatu section on the day of carnival with *Bigato Pereira*, from *Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico* who leads maracatu ensemble *Maracatu Asé d’Ori*, in Aracaju, Brazil, with *Thalita Domingues*.

#### CABOCLO 2 de JULHO

The final section of the Tambores Livres carnival procession will depict Caboclo 2 de Julho (Caboclo of the 2nd of July) who is a historical figure believed to have been the leader of a battalion of indigenous and mixed-race fighters in Bahia during the war for independence against the Portuguese. He is celebrated as a symbol of the independence of Bahia, but more than this, he is commemorated as a symbol to remember the forgotten soldiers, batalions of indigenous fighters using tribal weapons, the African slaves and free men, the poor and isolated communities that organised themselves to form the majority of the troops fighting for liberation.

This section of the parade will be led by Tribo which is a cross-cultural drumming and dance music project based in London which has a rich history of workshops, performances and community engagement. It has its origins in Bahia, Brazil, and runs regular Samba-Reggae sessions and drumming workshops in London and Zurich. Marcos Santana, from Bahia, leads the group and has taken a proactive role in this project and is known for developing positive relations across musical and cultural divides. He is supported in his work by his bother Anderson, sister Norma and lead dancer Adriano.

### DECORATION, THEMES, PLACARDS AND DESIGN

To effectively illustrate the theme of resistance, in the colours, t-shirts, decorations, costumes and props of the carnival procession,Tambores Livres is collaborating with carnival arts collective *Selva*, which is a collective of artists, producers and performers who work with Brazilian traditions. *Selva* generally focusses on processions and outdoor street theatre. The group has been active in London since 2015 and has performed in Bestival, Boomtown, Rich Mix and private events. The group is led by *Manuela Benini*, a Brazilian carnival artist based in London, who works as a dancer, choreographer, facilitator and designer in London and internationally.

*Manuela Benini* is the Carnival Designer for *Tambores Livres*, and is coordinating the theme, design, decoration and delivery of this important narrative for the whole procession, and is drawing on the visual language of protests and demonstrations and the beauty of Afro-Brazilian and Latin-American popular art and culture to set the framework of this carnival message.

### Mestre Chacon

Mestre Chacon is the multi-talented leader of Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico, one of the most widely-celebrated maracatu groups from Recife, northeastern Brazil.  

Growing up as part of a religious and cultural group that were in the forefront of resistance has been instrumental in Mestre Chacon’s career. He has become a religious and cultural leader at the center of the impoverished community of the Bode, in the favela of Pina, Recife, Pernambuco.

Chacon was the lead drummer in the group as a young man and in 2002 assumed the post of Master of the Whistle (it is with the whistle that much of the conducting is achieved), and of Master of the Batuque (drumming group) He gave a new impulse to the group and the whole community.  His strong musicality brings innovations to the beat without losing the tradition in which it was created. The group is known for the rich creation of songs and for the instrumental innovation in their drumming.

### Maracatu

Maracatu is an ancient carnival tradition, emerging from slave culture of north eastern Brazil
and mixing rhythms and beliefs from West Africa and South West Africa, Europe and South America.
It is most often based around a religious place of worship, a terreiro, of the Afro-Brazilian religion
Candomblé Nagô. Maracatus came into existence, in the most part, as a way for the communities to disguise
their drum based religious rituals as carnival band rehearsals and thus avoid police raids and censure.

### Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico
The group Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico, which is the partner group *Baque de Axé* and Baque de Ogum,
has a long history of resistance, change and development, and periods of near disappearance, until
reaching its current position as one of the most successful Maracatu bands in Recife. Iit was first
officially registered as a carnival band in 1916 in the city of Palmarinha in Palmares, Pernambuco.
Palmares is an old Quilombo community and a deep source of Afro-Brazilian culture and traditions.
