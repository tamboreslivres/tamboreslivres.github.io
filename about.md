</div>
[**JOIN US**](contact) at *Notting Hill Carnival* in a vibrant Brazilian style parade for democracy and human rights.

Across London a movement is taking shape. A movement of socially concerned Brazilians and people of all corners of the world who are determined to shine a light on those that have resisted and continue to fight for rights and democracy.

**TAMBORES LIVRES** is unprecedented [collaboration](collaborators) between different Brazilian musical, cultural groups, which are coming together to celebrate Brazilian heroes and heroines at Notting Hill Carnival. Tambores livres is a loud response to the rise of the far right in Brazil, where anti-democratic attitudes are  growing; activists, politicians, community and cultural leaders are being assassinated; political figures are being falsely imprisoned ; and the deforestation of the Amazonian rain forest is accelerating on an unforeseen scale.

Tambores Livres will be celebrating the lives and struggles of three Brazilian heroes/heroines, **MARIELLE FRANCO**, **MESTRE MOA** and **CABOCLO  2 de JULHO** to the sound of a Berimbau Orchestra, four maracatu and samba reggae bands, dancers, placards/banners and very special guests.
