*Tambores Livres* (Free drums) is a project specially created for the 2019 Notting Hill Carnival.  Several groups that work in different Brazilian musical and cultural traditions have worked together to create Tambores Livres , an explosive, cohesive and artistic message through music, dance and chants, costumes and banners, placards and movement, and lots of drums. The maracatu group Baque de Axe, who won third prize in the Brazilian section of the 2018 Notting Hill carnival, coordinated the proposal, which has been awarded an Arts Council National Lottery Award Project Grant (ACNLPG) to develop the Carnival project.

A component of the project is a series of music and cultural education workshops for children in schools and community groups, based on the music of Tambores Livres and the Afro-Brazilian cultural traditions from which it derives.

The five groups working together on this project are; Baque de Axé from London, and Baque de Ogum from Durham, both maracatu bands who have developed strong links with Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico , a leading maracatu band in Recife; leading samba reggae band Tribo, capoeira group Marazul who will present a Berimbau orchestra; and Baque Luar, an all-female group who play maracatu and other Brazilian rhythms; and they will be supported in carnival development by collective Selva. A new song will be developed through the collaboration of all the band leaders, and with the participation of “Mestre Chacon” (Jailson Viana Chacon) of Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico, who will be visiting the UK in July. The song will involve a wide range of Brazilian percussion instruments including players of the bow-like berimbau, alongside dancers and capoeira martial-artists.

Tambores Livres has chosen ‘Heroes and Heroines of Brazilian Resistance’ as the theme (enredo) for the carnival parade, linking all elements of the procession. This will be illustrated through The theme Tambores Livres and will focus on resistance in Brazil, and present three heroes of Brazilian resistance: **Marielle Franco**, **Mestre Moa do Katendé**, and **Caboclo 2 de Julho**.

Mestre Chacon is the multi-talented leader of Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico, one of the most widely-celebrated maracatu groups from Recife, northeastern Brazil.  

Growing up as part of a religious and cultural group that were in the forefront of resistance has been instrumental in Mestre Chacon’s career. He has become a religious and cultural leader at the centre of an impoverished community of the Bode, in the favela of Pina, Recife, Pernambuco.

Chacon was the lead drummer in the group as a young man and in 2002 assumed the post of Master of the Whistle (it is with the whistle that much of the conducting is achieved), and of Master of the Batuque (drumming group) He gave a new impulse to the group and the whole community.  His strong musicality brings innovations to the beat without losing the tradition in which it was created. The group is known for the rich creation of songs and for the instrumental innovation in their drumming.

## Maracatu
Maracatu is an ancient carnival tradition, emerging from slave culture of north eastern Brazil and mixing rhythms and beliefs from Africa, Europe and South America in infectious performance. Historically it used playfulness, and satire to address issues that could otherwise not be broached.

## Maracatu Nação Porto Rico
The group Maracatu Porto Rico, which is the partner group of Baque de Axe and Baque de Ogum, has a long history of resistance, change and development, and periods of near disappearance, until reaching its current apogee as one of the most successful Maracatu bands in Recife. Its official foundation in the record book dates from 1916 in the city of Palmares, Pernambuco. Palmares is an old Quilombo community (communities of runaway slaves living independently in remote spots, often for centuries), and they are a deep source of Afro-Brazilian culture and traditions.
