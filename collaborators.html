        <h4>Nação de Maracatu Porto Rico</h4>
        <div>
            The group Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico, which is the partner group of Baque de Axé and Baque de Ogum, has a long history of resistance, change and development, and periods of near disappearance, until reaching its current position as one of the most successful Maracatu bands in Recife. Iit was first officially registered as a carnival band in 1916 in the city of Palmarinha in Palmares, Pernambuco. Palmares is an old Quilombo community and a deep source of Afro-Brazilian culture and traditions.
            Nacao Maractu Porto Rico is a carnival and cultural group from Recife, Brazil, is being represented by leader Mestre Chacon, who is visiting London in the run up carnival to deliver workshops with maracatu players in the UK.
            Two of the Nação’s percussionists and teachers will be parading and performing with Tambores Livres, representing the Nacao do Maracatu Porto Rico on the day of carnival.
