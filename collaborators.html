                The group Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico, which is the partner group
                of Baque de Axé and Baque de Ogum, has a long history of resistance,
                change and development, and periods of near disappearance, until reaching
                its current position as one of the most successful Maracatu bands in Recife.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was first officially registered as a carnival band in 1916 in the city
                of Palmarinha in Palmares, Pernambuco. Palmares is an old Quilombo community
                and a deep source of Afro-Brazilian culture and traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nacao Maractu Porto Rico is a carnival and cultural group from Recife,
                Brazil, being represented by leader Mestre Chacon, who is visiting
                London in the run up to carnival to deliver workshops with maracatu players in the UK.
                Two of the Nação’s percussionists and teachers — <strong style="color: #fd7e14">Bigato Pereira</strong> and
                <strong style="color: #fd7e14">Thalita de Faria Domingues</strong> — will be parading and performing with
                Tambores Livres, representing the Nacao do Maracatu Porto Rico on the day of carnival.
