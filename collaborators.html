                    At Notting Hill Carnival 2019, Mestre Joãozinho brought together
                    over 20 berimbau players to create the first berimbau orchestra
                    at Notting Hill Carnival. Fully integrated into the mass
                    band and also performing separately, it was made up of members
                    of many different capoeira groups including MarAzul,
                    Grove Capoeira, Senzala Capoeira Nativos - London,

                    Selva is a collective of artists, producers and performers
                    who work draws from Brazilian and Latin American traditions.
                    Selva supports positive disruptive behaviour working mainly
                    in processions and interventions in public and private spaces.
                    The group has been active in London since 2015.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The leader of Selva, Manuela Benini was instrumental in
                    bringing this project to the street. As creative director,
                    she helped coordinate all visuals with the theme, ran a
                    two-week 14 hour a day carnival camp in Greenwich, organised
                    choreography for the dancers and developed our awareness of
                    many issues. The camp brought together activists, musicians,
                    artists and dancers and this created dialogue and
                    understanding between very different people and perspectives.
                    Selva also produced street theatre and a special section of
                    participants called the Selva Bloco who moved around during
                    the procession

        <h4>Nação de Maracatu Porto Rico</h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                The group Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico, which is the partner group of Baque de Axé and Baque de Ogum, has a long history of resistance, change and development, and periods of near disappearance, until reaching its current position as one of the most successful Maracatu bands in Recife.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was first officially registered as a carnival band in 1916 in the city of Palmarinha in Palmares, Pernambuco. Palmares is an old Quilombo (Maroon) community and a deep source of Afro-Brazilian culture and traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nação do Maracatu Porto Rico is a carnival and cultural group from Recife, Brazil, and has been represented by leader <strong style="color: #fd7e14">Mestre Chacon</strong>, who visited London in the run up to carnival to deliver workshops with maracatu players in the UK, and to compose the song for NHC19, Grito pela Liberdade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two of the Nação’s percussionists and teachers — <strong style="color: #fd7e14">Bigato Pereira</strong> and <strong style="color: #fd7e14">Thalita de Faria Domingues</strong> — spent time in London and Durham working with and performing with Baque de Axé and Baque de Ogum and paraded with Tambores Livres, representing the Nacao do Maracatu Porto Rico on the day of carnival.
