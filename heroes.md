### Mestre Moa Do Katende
*"Enquanto houver desigualdade, seremos resistência!
Quando o afoxé tocar na sua vida, quero vê seus olhos cheios de alegria!
Quem vai quebrar a máquina do mal ?!
A felicidade do afoxé é dançar a ouvir o agogô ao som do ijexá.
Vamos dançar com fé é tempo de afoxé !
Voa a mensagem bonita pro mundo saber, devolva em luz aos amigos de Katendê.
Seu espírito de luta vai civilizando.”*

to have been the leader of a battalion of indigenous and mixed-race fighters in
Bahia during the war for independence against the Portuguese.

he is commemorated as a symbol to remember the forgotten soldiers,
battalions of indigenous fighters using tribal weapons, the African slaves and free men,
the poor and isolated communities that organised themselves to form the majority
of the troops fighting for liberation.
