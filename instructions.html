        <h4>General information</h4>
        <p>
            You are welcome to come along and get involved with the activities on the
            Saturday, to help the final preparations and <strong>get your all-important T-shirt!</strong>
            There will also be a final combined band rehearsal to watch and that should
            get you in the mood for the main parade Monday! T-shirts can also be picked
            up Sunday at Maxilla and Monday (8am).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>On the Monday, the meeting time is earlier – 9:00am</strong>, if you have your
            t-shirt, or <strong>8:00am if you don’t</strong>. Roads will be closed around the carnival
            area and tubes may be busy.
        </p>
        <h4>Clothes</h4>
        <p>
            keep an eye on the weather. Ideally white trousers and white trainers
            but anything else is ok. We want the T-shirt on top so it can be worn
            over a warm layer or two if it is looking cold , or a waterproof if wet.
            Please add carnival make-up and hair wear if you want! Small waist bags are
            ok to wear but <strong>no rucksacks please</strong> as they obscures the logo
            on the t-shirts. Belongings/valuables can be left in a locked van if required.
        </p>
        <h4>Water & Food</h4>
        <p>
            There will be water to take from stewards on the parade route but
            bring a bottle if you want and if it looks like hot weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            We don’t supply any food but there will be opportunities around the parade
            for a food stop and plenty of nearby carnival food stalls.
        </p>
        <h4>Safety</h4>
        <p>
            There will be a number of Tambores Livres stewards around the parade
            group - protecting our perimeter and helping with water - plus two
            dedicated NHC official stewards and Police liaison officers.
            We have a first aider in case of any minor injuries or issues.
            As with any big public event, please be aware that there will be
            large numbers of people around, especially as we finish the parade
            so just be aware of things like phones and wallets etc and keep an
            eye on the crowds as you pass through back to the Maxilla club.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-center mt-4">
            Have a great Carnival and let’s create a big noise for our heroes
            and the TL cause. Brazil we are watching you!
