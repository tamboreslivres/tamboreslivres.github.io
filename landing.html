                                Right now, as you are reading this, across London, the UK and in Brazil, a
                                movement is taking shape. A movement of socially concerned Brazilians and friends
                                who are determined to shine a light on those that have resisted and continue to
                                resist.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Brazil, popular culture itself has often been an act of resistance, a forum
                                where traditions are kept alive, where afro-Brazilian communities stick together
                                and express their art and culture, overcoming many obstacles and difficulties.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Resistance shapes culture and saves communities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, at the end of last year, several groups, from different Brazilian musical and
                                cultural traditions, realised that after meeting at socially conscious Brazilian
                                events and protests at the end of last year, that they needed to express a
                                heartfelt, explosive, cohesive and artistic message through music, dance and
                                chants, costumes and banners, placards and movement, and lots of drums, together
                                at Notting Hill Carnival in 2019.
