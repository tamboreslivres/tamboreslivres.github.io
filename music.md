### Maracatu

Maracatu is an ancient carnival tradition, emerging from slave culture of north eastern Brazil and mixing rhythms and beliefs from West Africa and South West Africa, Europe and South America. It is most often based around a religious place of worship, a terreiro, of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé Nagô. Maracatus came into existence, in the most part, as a way for the communities to disguise their drum based religious rituals as carnival band rehearsals and thus avoid police raids and censure.
