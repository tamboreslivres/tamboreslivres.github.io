### Maracatu

Maracatu is an ancient carnival tradition, emerging from slave culture of north
eastern Brazil and mixing rhythms and beliefs from West Africa and South West
Africa, Europe and South America. It is most often based around a religious
place of worship, a terreiro, of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé Nagô.
Maracatus came into existence, in the most part, as a way for the communities
to disguise their drum based religious rituals as carnival band rehearsals and
thus avoid police raids and censure.
