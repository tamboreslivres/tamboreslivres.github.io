            A major part of the Tambores Livres project has been the Education Outreach programme which has seen band leaders and assistants from Tambores Livres visit 9 community centres and schools across London.
        </p>
        <p class="mx-4 p-4">
            <i>“Developing approaches to working in schools and community groups with this music and its traditions, developing musical expression as a way of communicating, collaborating, and working together towards a common goal.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Planned, monitored and coordinated by <strong>Maxine McCarthy</strong>, of <i>Baque de Axé</i>, this programme is giving children across London the opportunity to share in the music that we brought together at carnival, the reasons we came together and what we are learning in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“How can we play music together?""</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“How do we make our message heard in a positive way?”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“What different roles can we take to achieve that result?”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“How can we be responsible, have fun and be creative all at the same time?”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            These nine drumming workshops in London schools and community centres worked with 400 young people. This is key to the legacy of the Tambores Livres project as we build links with schools and community centres, develop drumming, communication and team building skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the medium term, our objective is to develop consistent, regular engagement with different communities across London. In the long term we would like to build upon the work being done by new Tambores Livres collectives in Aracaju, Brazil and Brighton, UK, and to further develop this dialogue between communities and cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
            As artists and teachers, our leaders can communicate an understanding of how the rich history of music, folklore and carnival in Brazil, and in London, has been shaped by different peoples and cultures, and how this diversity is our strength!
